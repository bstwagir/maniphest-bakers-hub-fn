**Maniphest Bakers Hub**  is designed to connect skilled home-based bakers, who may not be formally employed, with consumers seeking quality, locally-made pastries. The idea behind this initiative is to empower talented bakers, who may lack direct access to a broader customer base, by providing them with a platform to showcase their work.

## Introduction

Our project is designed to connect skilled home-based bakers, who may not be formally employed, with consumers seeking quality, locally-made pastries. The idea behind this initiative is to empower talented bakers, who may lack direct access to a broader customer base, by providing them with a platform to showcase their work. Through this app, we aim to bridge the gap between home bakers and pastry lovers, offering a convenient way for consumers to enjoy fresh baked goods while supporting local artisans.
